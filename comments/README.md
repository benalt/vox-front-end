Comments Prototype
=============

This uses nodejs - you'll need to install it from: http://nodejs.org/#download

All node modules that are used are included, so you shouldn't need to install any modules.

Markups
-------

Use - this is kicked off from the termonal - cd into <projectDir>/comments/javascript
  
and run the line:

node commentsServer.js

This command will spin up a server that will run at localhost:1337/

Hit that URL and it should work. This is still buggy, and a lot of the placement things and comment rendering is off. Some of the js needs to be cleaned up - I got a little impatient and bleary-eyed as I closed in on this.
