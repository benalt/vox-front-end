Power isn’t important, and OBP is nice, but comes second to speed.</p>\n<blockquote>The Book says OBP is king.  The lead-off hitter comes to bat only 36% of the time with a runner on base, versus 44% of the time for the next lowest spot in the lineup, so why waste homeruns?  The lead-off hitter also comes to the plate the most times per game, so why give away outs?  As for speed, stealing bases is most valuable in front of singles hitters, and since the top of the order is going to be full of power hitters, they’re not as important.  The lead-off hitter is one of the best three hitters on the team, the guy without homerun power.

There were clubs, grounds and a tradition of playing bat and ball games among adults in St. Louis prior to the advent of the New York game in the city in 1859.  The new game latched onto these traditions and the community of ballplayers gravitated to the new game.  The traditions that surrounded the playing of town ball and cricket in St. Louis made it easier for the new game to be accepted and grow in St. Louis.  I think that the fact that some of the original Empire Club members were cricketers supports that argument.</blockquote>","replyTo":{"id":""},"replies":["92803895"],"time":"Feb 23, 2012 1:00 AM EST","recommended":false,"commenter":{"name":"The Continental","url":"http://www.sbnation.com/users/The%20Continental","avatarUrl":"http://cdn3.sbnation.com/profile_images/599628/TheContenental_small.jpg","signature":"<p>Retire #52!</p>"}},"comment_92803895":{"id":"92803895","index":805,"title":"Is 'town ball' the same as corkball?","body":"","replyTo":{"id":"92803166"},"replies":["92805527"],"time":"Feb 23, 2012 1:14 AM EST","recommended":false,"commenter":{"name":"peach concrete","url":"http://www.sbnation.com/users/peach%20concrete","avatarUrl":"http://cdn2.sbnation.com/profile_images/572570/peach_small.jpg","signature":""}},"comment_92805527":{"id":"92805527","index":806,"title":"Not sure of the actual mechanics of what he calls \"town ball\"","body":"<p>Thought this was interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>As I’ve mentioned before, Lincoln, when he moved to Illinois, arrived in a community that had a vibrant ballplaying culture. <a href=\"http://thisgameofgames.blogspot.com/2010/07/lincoln-baseball-legend-great-ball.html\" target=\"new\">A baseball variant, that the locals specifically remembered as being called town ball, was played in central Illinois in the 1820s and 1830s.</a> Other ball games that were played during the antebellum era included bullpen, cross out and long town.
